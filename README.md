Descrição:
This project implements a function that takes a positive integer and returns the sum of all integer values divisible by 3 or 5 that are less than the number passed.

Examples:
- If the function receives the integer 10, it must return 23, resulting from the sum of the numbers 3, 5, 6 and 9 that are less than 10.
- If the function receives the integer 11, it must return 33, resulting from the sum of the numbers 3, 5, 6, 9 and 10 that are less than 11.

##Run TEST:
Download the repository, unzip and open the index.html in the browser. When you enter 11 in the integer field, the expected result 33 will appear on the screen and when you type 10, the expected result would be 23.
